HOW TO MAKE MONSTER USE FUNNY TRIGGER LOCATIONS:

PART 1 - SETTING UP THE TRIGGER IN-GAME

	Step 1: 
		Make your own template version of the messenger stagehand because the default one only respects players
	Step 2: 
		Adjust your template to use whatever categories of entity you want
			player
			npc
			monster
			object
			vehicle
			itemDrop
			projectile
			creature
		
	Step 3: 
		Place your trigger ingame somewhere. 
		Most of the missions have a messenger stagehand near the boss door that you can copypaste and edit to use your custom stagehand type
	
PART 2 - SETTING UP YOUR CREATURE TO USE HOOKS

	Step 1: 
		Make a new behavior hook script. For an example see:
		/monsters/lofty_irisil_monsterHooks.lua
		This script needs to contain a message handler func for each type of message you want to send with your ingame trigger.
	
	Step 2: 
		In order for this script to get used by your creature you need to give your creature a behavior that uses it.
		For an example of how to do this see:
		/behaviors/monsters/critter/lofty_irisil_hooked_walking.behavior
		
		In this example we initialize (in this case, both of) our hook scripts.
		The first one turns on our listener, the second is a basic switcheroo that swaps us back to the vanilla critter behavior once our listener is running.
		
		To add a behavior with a custom script hook callback you need to add a behavior .nodes entry too
		Check out /behaviors/nodes/lofty_irisil.nodes for examples
	
	Step 3:
		You need to add the scripts you made to the scripts list in your monster's .monstertype file or it will not spawn correctly
	
	Step 4:
		Now that your monster is listening for messages and your messenger is set up ingame, it should be able to send a message to your monster.

Irisil outfit that acts like the poptop pants

Mission involving the Novakid artifact but it turns out to be a sombrero with a bunch of flashing lights
Your contact is Jimmy Jalapeno after finishing Dantalion/Swansong

The rare variant of Irisil will be named Spirisil and look sorta Ori-ish
Spirisil will only be able to be encountered at the end of a dungeon
The dungeon will only be accessible if you have collected the tokens from the other challenge door dungeons

Mission where you wake up in a gnome village then have to save them from an Irisa that is stepping on their houses
boss fight is basically just big paw that comes down from above
reward is gnomish minigun that sprays a lot of very flashy colorful bullets

Add my own chest/body/back/leg hiders so we don't have to rely on the ones from other mods full of low quality clothes

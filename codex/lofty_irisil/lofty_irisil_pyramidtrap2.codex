Spike pits are tools that allow you to control where intruders are standing while they visit your home, crypt, etc.

In many cases, spikes alone are more than enough to handle uninvited guests, but pointy objects work best in the roles of intimidation and zoning! It is better to consider the spike pit as a gentle guiding force that sets your other traps up for success.

Boulder traps are effective and elegant additions to anyone's lair. Falling stones appeal to a simpler time, and really bring back the rustic vibes of the traps of antiquity. Well-placed rocks are always in vogue!

More importantly, rock traps work well together with spike pits - an intruder will often focus their attention on avoiding spikes, which leaves them vulnerable to ambush from above!

Fluids like ^#5500aa;oil^reset; and ^green;slime^reset; are also simple and deadly.

By themselves, these substances can suffocate intruders or slow their movements- but these fluids' properties also greatly increase the efficacy of other traps!

Running away from a rolling boulder is much more difficult for someone covered in viscous oil or sticky slime.

Shallow pools of just about any fluid can also be used to conceal pressure plates - the last type of simple trap we'll be covering in this chapter.

Traditionally, pressure plates stay dry, but adding just enough fluid to submerge a switch can help you hide your traps in plain sight. Your visitors aren't going to check to make sure the oil is safe before they step in it.

Pressure plates also work well when positioned on shelves or walls!

Don't be afraid to put these kinds of hidden switches in new and exciting places to keep your victims guessing. 

In addition to serving the purpose of fostering paranoia, creative pressure plate placement also adds personality and flair to your deadly machinations!"
